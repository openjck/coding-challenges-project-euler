Solutions to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems) in
languages that I find interesting. I enjoy solving these as challenges.

I have been focusing on Haskell so far and will probably continue to focus on
Haskell moving forward.

For each problem, I provide one original solution and may also provide one
improved solution. The original solution may be based on some light research
about related topics, but I really try not to spoil the answer for myself. The
improved solution may be based on anything else, including further reading,
solutions posted on the Project Euler website, etc.

When I do write an improved solution, I usually write it shortly after writing
the original solution. I don't often go back and improve very old solutions
based on things I learned much later. Therefore, the code for my improved
problem 10 solution will probably be better than the code for my improved
problem 1 solution.
