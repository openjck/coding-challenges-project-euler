Solutions to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems) in
languages that I find interesting. I work on these solutions because I enjoy
challenging myself.

For each problem, I provide one original solution and may also provide one
improved solution. The original solution may be based on some light research
about related topics, but I really try not to spoil the answer for myself. The
improved solution may be based on anything else, including further reading,
solutions posted on the Project Euler website, solutions that other Project
Euler participants share, etc.
